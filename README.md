## The Marriage of Symbolic Logic & Deep Learning

### Title

[The Marriage of Symbolic Logic & Deep Learning (Chinese version)](../blob/master/The%20Marriage%20of%20Symbolic%20Logic%20%26%20Deep%20Learning%20(Hulu%2C%20Xiaoran%20Xu).pdf)

### Abstract

Symbolic logic was born of “logicism” and “formalism” before AI and developed quickly during the early stage of AI, known as automatic reasoning techniques, expert systems and knowledge graphs, while deep learning was the peak of artificial neural networks in the new era, bringing “connectionism”back to the public. Do these two schools always cause conflicts, or do they eventually go towards unification? What do we really need to reach AGI from the current AI level?
